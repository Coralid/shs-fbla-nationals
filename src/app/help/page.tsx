                name of any of the partners will direct you to their individual page, where you can see their info in a
                more convenient format. When you are logged in, you can also

                This page is unique to each partner, and displays all the information we store on them. This includes:
                name, address, phone number, and the category they fall under. If you are logged in, you also have
